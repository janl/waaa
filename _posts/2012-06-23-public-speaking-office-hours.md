Interesting in speaking, but don't know where to start? Come hang out at office
hours and brainstorm with other aspiring speakers. Mentors with speaking
experience will also be there to answer your questions.

## IRC office hours

Weekly office hours will be held over IRC.

* Time: Tuesdays 10am Pacific Time, 7pm Central European Time
* Channel: [#weareallawesome on freenode](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=weareallawesome)

## New to IRC? Don’t be nervous!

There are many ways to connect to Internet Relay Chat (IRC), just as there are many ways to access the web or your email. The easiest way is to use a web-based IRC client. You don’t have to decide which one now, just:

1. Follow this link: [http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=weareallawesome](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=weareallawesome)
2. Choose a nickname (I recommend your Twitter handle)
3. Enter the reCAPTCHA.
4. Connect.

Easy :)
