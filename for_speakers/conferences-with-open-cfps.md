# {{ page.title }}

In order to get yourself in front of an audience, you first have to be selected as a speaker, and for that, you need to submit talk proposals. I'll be making a list of conferences accepting proposals here.

There are a lot of great, up-to-date resources listing open speaker calls. Here are some good ones:

## [Lanyrd’s list of Calls For participation](http://lanyrd.com/calls/)

An auto-generated list of upcoming CFPs pulled from Lanyrd’s wiki-style conference listings. Ordered by deadline and cab be filtered by topic!

If you are a conference organizer, add your CFP details to your conference listing so it automatically appears in this list.

## [CallbackWomen](https://twitter.com/callbackwomen) on Twitter

An account that tweets and retweets about CFPs.

If you are a conference organizer, mention @callbackwomen to get a retweet.
