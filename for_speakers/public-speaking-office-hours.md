## New to IRC? Don’t be nervous!

There are many ways to connect to Internet Relay Chat (IRC), just as there are many ways to access the web or your email. The easiest way is to use a web-based IRC client. You don’t have to decide which one now, just:

1. Follow this link: [http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=weareallawesome](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=weareallawesome)
2. Choose a nickname (I recommend your Twitter handle)
3. Enter the reCAPTCHA.
4. Connect.

Easy :)
